# Open Sourcery 2018
30 points

## Challenge 
> The solution to this problem lies within the Chromium source code. Literally. There is some string in there that mentions a flag and PACTFâ€¦

## Hint
> This problem builds off of a similarly named problem in PACTF 2017.

## Solution
 
Last year's solution involved some regex in the `transport_security_state_static.json` file.

(Look at the solution for [Open Sourcery 2017](https://writeups.amosng.com/2017/pactf_2017/boole/open-sourcery-2_40/) by @LFlare)

This year it is simpler: `Ctrl+F` or use `grep`.
