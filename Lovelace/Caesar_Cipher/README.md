## Challenge 
> “Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant only taste of death but once.” (1007, 1008) Are you valiant enough to figure this out?

## Hint
> There’s a lot of text on the Internet and in print. What if you could send messages using all of that data? But you’d have to pick something pretty famous…

## Solution

Search the quote and [we find it here -- The Tragedy of Julius Caesar](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=juliuscaesar&Act=2&Scene=2&Scope=scene).

We can see that line 1007 and 1008 is the exact location of the quote.

Hence, the numbers are probably in the form of `line:word`
	
	Line 5 = Upon a labouring day without [the] sign
	Line 1139 = Stay not to [answer] me, but get thee gone: 
	Line 1620 = The good [is] oft interred with their bones; 
	Line 172 = I would not, [Cassius]; yet I love him well. 

	// 5:6 1139:4 1620:3 172:4
	// [the answer is Cassius]
