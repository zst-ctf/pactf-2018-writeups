## Solution

Java random number generator (Read: `Oracle Corporation`).

Hence, it has to do with finding the next value given 2 numbers in the sequence.

I found this:

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/51686/how-to-determine-the-next-number-from-javas-random-method

Modify the code to fit our needs

	$ javac solve.java
	$ java solve
	Starting
	Seed found: -135594114706202
	So we have that nextInt is: -1997362081 and 
	the third one is: -632232200 with seed: -135594114706202
