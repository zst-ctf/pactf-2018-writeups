	MEMORANDUM ON THE SECURITY OF PDF DOCUMENTS AND REDACTION
	Over the past several years, there have been several instances in which a journalist, government
	officer, or corporate executive has released an otherwise-secret document with redactions.
	Unfortunately, these amateur redactors often do a poor job hiding the data they mean to redact,
	and leave themselves vulnerable to even the most trivial exploits.
	Indeed, few issues pose as real and present a threat as poorly redacted PDF documents. If you
	wish to release a PDF document, be sure to release only an image of the file—that way, you won’t
	be vulnerable to leaks.
	The flag is `b3_car3ful_0r_y0ur_l3ak_m1ght_l3ak`.
